# Setup and Usage Guide for Whisper Transcription and Translation Notebook

This guide will walk you through the process of using the "OpenAI_Whisper_V3_Large_Transcription_Translation.ipynb" notebook to transcribe or translate audio files. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have a Google account as you will need it to access Google Colab.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Download the Notebook**: Start by downloading the *"OpenAI_Whisper_V3_Large_Transcription_Translation.ipynb"* notebook directly from the GitHub repository.

2. **Open the Notebook in Google Colab**: Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), and sign in with your Google account. Then, upload the downloaded notebook to Colab by clicking on `File > Upload notebook`.

3. **Connect to a Runtime**: Once the notebook is open in Colab, you'll need to connect to a runtime environment to execute the code. We recommend using the T4 GPU, which is free and generally sufficient for most tasks. You can connect to a runtime by clicking on `Runtime > Change runtime type` and selecting `GPU` as the hardware accelerator.

4. **Adjust the Notebook Settings**: Before running the notebook, make sure to adjust the code to fit your specific needs. This may include specifying the filename of the audio file you wish to transcribe and translate, as well as setting your task preferences.

5. **Execute the Notebook**: Run the entire notebook by clicking on `Runtime > Run all`. Alternatively, you can execute each cell individually by clicking the play button next to it.

6. **Access Your Output**: Once the notebook has finished running, your output files will be available in the Google Colab's `/content/` directory. You can download these files to your local machine by right-clicking on them and selecting `Download`.

## Additional Tips

- If you encounter any issues while running the notebook, make sure to check the runtime logs for any error messages.
- For more detailed information on each step within the notebook, refer to the comments and documentation provided within the notebook itself.
